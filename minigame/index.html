    <h1>A Minigame of Digital Beings in a Digital City</h1>
    <p>
        Greetings and welcome to the city of Rivega -- <b>Residential Integrated Virtual Ecosystem and Growth
            Accelerator</b>. Here, new digital beings get born based on the habits of the governor, and right now,
        that's me.

    <h2>Current Residents in the First District</h2>
    <p>
        The First District is important. It's about doing things, it's about small wins that becomes big wins with time
        and patience. You may imagine it populate with some general random avatars of multiple world generic people: but
        I'll name the ones that matters here.
    </p>
    <p>
        The leadership of the town belongs to <b><span class="c__tasknotation"></span></b>. Her job is annotate every
        task that needs to be done, so we get sure it gets f* done. And that is her: a maniac with a pen or a tablet or
        a napkin where she writes down what comes next. <span class="c__tasknotation"></span> has an affair with <span
            class="c__waterdrink"></span>.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b><span class="c__waterdrink"></span></b> is a very important creature in this city. She cares about drinking
        the right amount of water every day, and she's always reminding everyone to do the same. She's a bit of a health
        freak but right now she is alone in this area of work. She balances well the emotions of <span
            class="c__tasknotation"></span>.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b><span class="c__tasknotation"></span></b> has <span class="c__tasknotation__exp"></span> points of
        experience.
